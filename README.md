# ðŸš— RC Car Using ESP32

This project is a **remotely controlled RC car** built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, which acts as a web server to enable wireless communication. The car is powered by **three 3.7V Lithium-ion batteries** and uses **four gear motors** for movement.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Wireless Control** via an ESP32 web server.
- **Four Gear Motors** with PWM-based speed control for smooth turning.
- **Custom Chassis** made from **cardboard** reinforced with **ice cream sticks**.
- **Three 3.7V Lithium-ion Batteries** for efficient power management.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The ESP32 hosts a **web interface** that allows the user to send movement commands.
2. The **four gear motors** control the movement and direction.
3. **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** is used to adjust motor speed for turns.
4. A **custom-built chassis** provides lightweight yet durable support.

## âš¡ Components Used
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| ESP32 | Microcontroller handling web communication |
| 4 Gear Motors | Used for movement |
| L298N Motor Driver | Controls motor speed and direction |
| 3x 3.7V Lithium-ion Batteries | Power source |
| Custom Chassis | Made from **cardboard** and reinforced with **ice cream sticks** |

## ðŸ›  Challenges Faced
- Initially tried using a **servo motor** for steering, but it lacked the power to turn the car.
- Switched to **four gear motors** and implemented **PWM-based speed control** to achieve turning.
- Designed a **lightweight yet sturdy chassis** using cardboard and ice cream sticks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
- Adding **autonomous navigation** using sensors.
- Improving **battery efficiency** for longer run times.
- Enhancing the **web interface** for a better user experience.
